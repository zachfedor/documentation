# Welcome to Pubforge

## Some things to know about our network:

### Internet

We have two ISPs, and traffic is load balanced between the two networks.  While
your outgoing IP address won't change often, it may switch periodically.

### LAN in the Crucible

All ethernet ports in the Crucible are active and can be connected to by any
Crucible member.  All computers on the Crucible network are on the same subnet,
and are not isolated from each other to facilitate sharing, gaming, and collaboration.

If you'd like an isolated connection, come talk to us.

### Monitoring / Firewall

All network traffic is subject to monitoring and logging, for troubleshooting
purposes.

All web and file transfer traffic is subject to a gateway anti-virus scan.

SMTP on port 25 is actively prohibited to help prevent spam.

### Printer

Our copier/MFP is a Kyocera 3051ci.  The IP address is: **10.0.100.10**. Use the Line Printer Daemon protocol. Download the drivers [here](https://www.kyoceradocumentsolutions.eu/index/service/dlc.false.driver.TASKALFA3051CI._.EN.html)

### Wifi

Crucible members get access to the 'Pubforge Crucible' wifi network.  The password
is available from the manager on a daily basis.

*Please avoid sharing this password with non-crucible members - they will be
given access to a different network.*
